# multiclass-classification

This is my project from [Dicoding - Belajar Pengembangan Machine Learning](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/185) and i love to share my experience for prcticing NLP here.

I'm recommend this dataset to learn: **Natural Languange Processing (NLP)** this ["Emotion Dataset - Kaggle"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahwagih/emotion-dataset).

## Dataset<br>
this is top 5 from the dataset:
|                                          Comment | Emotion     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | 
|i seriously hate one subject to death but now ... |	fear       |
|im so full of life i feel appalled                |	anger      |
|i sit here to write i start to dig out my feel... | 	fear       |
|ive been really angry with r and i feel like a... |	joy        |
|i feel suspicious if there is no one outside l... |	fear       |

## Improvement List<br>
- [x] Connect notebook to the dataset using Kaggle API
- [x] Add more preprocessing for dataset (stemming, lemmatization, and handling non alphanumeric)
- [x] Create NLP Vizualization
- [x] Create model with 98% accucary on training and validation dataset
- [x] Try to apply pretrained word embeding
